= Desktop GNOME Apps =

We've chosen GNOME as our desktop user interface of choice. Rather than using the meta-packages they are deliberately expanded so that we can select things a bit better.

 * file-roller
 * (transmission-gtk)       # simple GNOME frontend for bittorrent downloads
 * gnome-menus
 * (libpam-gnome-keyring)
 * (firefox)
 * software-properties-gtk # default GUI sources.list editor / extra drivers
 * ubuntu-release-upgrader-gtk
 * update-manager
 * update-notifier
 * (xdg-utils)		   # useful utilities
 * xdg-user-dirs
 * xdg-user-dirs-gtk
 * gvfs-bin			# mostly used as xdg-open backend
 * (gvfs-fuse)			# let non-GNOME apps see GVFS via fuse

Themes: we will ship only the very best looking themes. We won't ship everything that Debian ships, just a custom package that includes the themes we want. These packages are included for size guidance until we have Ubuntu-specific packages.

 * gnome-themes-standard        # Adwaita cursor
 * clearlooks-phenix-theme
 * faenza-icon-theme

Settings: we have some settings overrides by default in an unique package.

The gstreamer0.10 packages we want to install until no gstreamer1.0 packages are on default media:

 * gstreamer0.10-alsa

The gstreamer1.0 packages we want to install:

 * gstreamer1.0-alsa

it is problematic to get these packages onto the installed system in order
to compile a driver. -mdz
