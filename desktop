= Desktop GNOME Apps =

We've chosen GNOME as our desktop user interface of choice. Rather than using the meta-packages they are deliberately expanded so that we can select things a bit better.

 * file-roller
 * (transmission-gtk)       # simple GNOME frontend for bittorrent downloads
 * gnome-menus
 * (libpam-gnome-keyring)
 * software-properties-gtk # default GUI sources.list editor / extra drivers
 * ubuntu-release-upgrader-gtk
 * update-manager
 * update-notifier
 * (xdg-utils)		   # useful utilities
 * xdg-user-dirs
 * xdg-user-dirs-gtk
 * gvfs-bin			# mostly used as xdg-open backend
 * (gvfs-fuse)			# let non-GNOME apps see GVFS via fuse

Themes: we will ship only the very best looking themes. We won't ship everything that Debian ships, just a custom package that includes the themes we want. These packages are included for size guidance until we have Ubuntu-specific packages.

 * clearlooks-phenix-theme
 * faenza-icon-theme

Settings: we have some settings overrides by default in an unique package.

The gstreamer0.10 packages we want to install until no gstreamer1.0 packages are on default media:

 * gstreamer0.10-alsa

The gstreamer1.0 packages we want to install:

 * gstreamer1.0-alsa

= Other Desktop GUI Apps =

Desktop Experience:

 * lxappearance
 * lxappearance-obconf
 * lxde-core
 * lxdm
 * lxsession-logout
 * leafpad
 * xfce4-terminal

= Development =

Here we provide a minimal development environment sufficient to build kernel
drivers, so that this is possible on the live CD and in scenarios where
it is problematic to get these packages onto the installed system in order
to compile a driver. -mdz

 * (gcc)
 * (make)

= Other =

 * linuxbean-desktop # metapackage for everything here
 * xserver-xorg-lts-xenial
 * xserver-xorg-video-all-lts-xenial
